## How-to add a new package manager

For now the easiest way to have new package managers supported is to:

1.  Fork the project.
2.  Identify an already implemented package manager that is similar to the new
    one youâ€™d like to add.
3.  Duplicate its already existing definition file in the
    {gh}`/managers subfolder <tree/develop/meta_package_manager/managers>`.
4.  Adapt the new file to the particularities of the new package manager. Read
    the {doc}`/falsehoods` to anticipate edge-cases.
5.  Fix the code until the unittests passes. Most of all metadata and format
    constraints for new managers are enforced in the unittest suite. See the
    {doc}`/development` page for more technical details.
6.  Send a PR.
